* Fast Edge Detection Library *

This library is a basic edge detection using Canny and Hough (well known) algoritms.
I decide to do my own library because the ones that I found were complex or not well optimized.

This library has no dependencies, is portable small and fast.

## Still is a work in progress library.
A lot of testing must be done. Until now I just coded the basics to implement the hough, but as a library is far from be usable.
